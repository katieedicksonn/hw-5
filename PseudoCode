 build html with bootstrap
 im going to need 10 rows with three col in them one for time one for input and one for save button 
grab current hours for the scheduler moment.hours
store in input box the numeric value stored in that box so im going to have to set a interval timer that updates every hours
i need color coded hours for past present and future 
loop through input box - look at numeric value
if statement if current time > row time = add class past 
else = present 
on click event for save nutton and event on that class 
THIS gives you the element you clikced on and the DOM triversal for which input matches 


i will need to svae to local storeage

$("#mybtn").on("click)
